##Why a Developer ?

When I was at high school, I decided to take a computer technology course. I remember having classes about Pascal and Delphi and being a relly good student at that subject, when everybody else was trying to copy my solutions for the questions to get good grades. By that time, I felt that software was what I'd like to do in my life.
Now I'm a developer with 7 years of experience and fully happy with my occupation. The nicest thing about it, is the fact that everyday I'm learning something new, that goes all the way from solving a code to people's behavior. The daily challanges and the possibility of making someone's life easier with my skills is what keeps me moving on. That is my awesome adventure as a Software Developer.
